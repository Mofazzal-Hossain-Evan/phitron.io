/*
This code is correct and should work for the problem. Here's how it works:

It declares a character array a of size 1001 to store the input string.
It reads the input string using scanf("%s", a);
It initializes a sum variable to 0.
It loops through each character of the string:

a[i] - '0' converts the character digit to its integer value.
This value is added to the sum.


Finally, it prints the sum.

The reason a[i] - '0' works is because in ASCII,
 the characters '0' to '9' are represented by consecutive integer values.
Subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from any digit character gives its integer value.
This code should work correctly for the problem as described. 
If it's still not being accepted, there might be some other issue, such as:

Input/output format: Make sure you're not printing any extra spaces or newlines.
Integer overflow: For very large numbers, 
you might need to use a long long int instead of int for the sum.
